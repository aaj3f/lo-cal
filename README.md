lo-cal is a locally-driven calendar for shows and events around Winston-Salem, NC.
Discover & keep track of small-venue shows, special screenings, and more.

## Objectives

1. To build a truly useful app, at first for the Winston-Salem, NC community, that broadcasts local events and provides an as-yet unavailable events aggregator to contribute to our community's fabric and to support local businesses.
2. To persist data vis-a-vis SQL database tables, relationally-mapped to model objects through ActiveRecord
3. To practice MVC design architecture with Create-Read-Update-Destroy capabilities & RESTful routing
4. To practice validating and authenticating users, to protect their identity & the security of the app.
